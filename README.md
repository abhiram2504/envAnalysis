# Detecting Anomalies in Water Quality for OSU's Carbon Footprint Reduction

## Introduction

Clean and reliable water is essential for any community, and The Ohio State University (OSU) is committed to maintaining the highest water quality standards. Our innovative initiative focuses on detecting anomalies in water quality, drawing inspiration from similar efforts in Alameda County, California. By identifying deviations in water quality data, we can address anomalies efficiently, ensuring OSU's environmental goals are met. This data-driven approach aligns with OSU's commitment to reduce its carbon footprint by **25% by 2025**, as it helps identify areas where environmental factors may contribute to these anomalies.

## Background

Alameda County, California, has provided valuable insights into the importance of identifying anomalies in water quality data, particularly in the context of broader environmental efforts. This highlights the need for anomaly detection systems that can help maintain sustainability and ensure optimal resource use.

## Project Proposal for OSU

### Anomaly Detection and Carbon Footprint Reduction

- **Data Integration:** Integrate water quality data with related datasets on air quality, waste management, and electricity usage. This provides a holistic view of environmental conditions on campus, allowing for more comprehensive analysis and anomaly detection.

- **Anomaly Detection Model:** Develop and implement a robust anomaly detection model capable of identifying deviations in water quality parameters. Special focus will be placed on anomalies linked to environmental factors that may increase carbon emissions, helping us pinpoint sources contributing to OSU's carbon footprint.

- **Response and Carbon Reduction:** Once anomalies are detected, a rapid response protocol will be triggered to efficiently address these deviations. This will help OSU work towards reducing its carbon footprint by **25% by 2025** through targeted interventions.

### Encouraging Sustainable Campus Practices

- **Emission Reduction Measures:** Implement data-driven measures to reduce emissions from campus activities that may be contributing to anomalies in water quality data, such as inefficient energy use or waste management practices.

- **Energy Efficiency:** Enhance energy efficiency across campus facilities, reducing potential environmental factors that impact water quality and contribute to carbon emissions.

### Interactive Carbon Calculator

- **User Engagement:** Create an interactive carbon calculator tool that helps users track their personal or departmental carbon footprint. The tool will offer suggestions for sustainable habits such as reducing energy consumption, recycling, and lowering water waste.

- **Real-Time Data Insights:** Present real-time data insights using engaging data visualizations, enabling users to easily understand their environmental impact and make informed decisions on improving sustainability.

## Long-Term Commitment to Sustainability

This project represents a long-term commitment to maintaining water quality and addressing anomalies efficiently. OSUâ€™s focus on anomaly detection is in line with the broader goal of reducing its carbon footprint by **25% by 2025**. Our data-driven, sustainable approach will help OSU meet its environmental goals, setting a precedent for other institutions to follow.

## Conclusion

By focusing on detecting anomalies in water quality data, OSU is taking a proactive, data-driven approach to maintain and improve environmental conditions on campus. With the current water quality model, along with upcoming models for air quality, waste management, and electricity usage, OSU will reduce its carbon footprint and promote sustainable behavior. This initiative raises awareness about climate issues, encourages eco-friendly habits, and demonstrates leadership in sustainability. Together, we can build a healthier and more sustainable environment for all.
